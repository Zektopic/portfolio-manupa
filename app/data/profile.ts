  about: "With a strong background in cloud computing, Linux, and electronics and telecommunications engineering, I design and manage diverse projects as a DevOps Engineer. I hold a B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University and am completing a B.Sc. in IT from the University of Moratuwa. A fast learner and naturally curious, I am always eager to explore new technologies. In my part-time, I love working on electronics projects. My passion for technology and innovation drives me to continuously learn and seek new opportunities in cloud computing.",
