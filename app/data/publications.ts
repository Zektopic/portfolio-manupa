    title: "Edge Computing using FPGA with the Deployment of Neural Networks for General Purpose Application",
    publisher: "KDU-IRC",
    date: "Oct 4, 2024",
    description: "This research explores the use of FPGAs for accelerating deep learning in edge computing, focusing on the Kria KV260 platform with a Xilinx system-on-module. It addresses the challenge of efficiently deploying neural networks on resource-constrained devices by proposing a solution for dynamic reconfiguration of deep neural networks (DNNs). The approach enables the simultaneous operation of multiple neural networks and Deep Processing Units (DPUs), improving flexibility and resource efficiency for AI tasks in IoT environments. The work highlights the potential of FPGA-accelerated AI for real-time inference at the edge."
